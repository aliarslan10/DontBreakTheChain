### Don't Break The Chain

This Spring Boot project will help the people to gain good habits. Users define a goal and they try to doing it day by day. For example reading book everyday can be a goal.

* Users can add goals
* They can mark their goals for each day as done
* If they want, they can back-up their goals to reach to them from everywhere.
